# MVP: Digital Preservation Scenario

* A **Data Producer**, e.g. a Researcher, wants to publish a paper about their research.

* The research is underpinned by a **Dataset**.

* The Data Producer wants to publish the Dataset to accompany their paper.

* The Dataset is made openly accessible and given a DOI.

* The Dataset is referenced in the paper using the DOI.

* The paper is published in a journal.

* A **Data Manager** at the Data Producer's institution is tasked with digital preservation of all published Datasets from their institution.

* The Data Manager uses the RDSS to preserve the dataset. 

* A **Data Consumer** (e.g. another researcher in a different organisation) subsequently discovers the Dataset and wants to use it.

* The Data Consumer follows the DOI for the Dataset which resolves to an access point to the Dataset, e.g. a Repository entry for the Dataset, and they then download the data.

The scenario above has three main stages:

* Upload and publication of the Dataset by the Data Producer
* Digital preservation by the Data Manager
* Discovery and download of the Dataset by a Data Consumer. 

These three stages are not necessarily independent of each other and they do not have to occur in sequence.  For example, the 'interactive workflow' supported by the MVP allows for the Data Manager to interact with the Data Producer during the data deposit and publication process and to use the preservation system to help understand the data and communicate with the Data Producer about how it could be improved in a way that helps with long-term usability.  Beyond the MVP, there will also be flexibility to use the preservation system to generate the access copy of the data before the Dataset is made public.

Not all steps necessarily involve the Jisc RDSS.  For example, the Dataset may initially be uploaded to a local CRIS or Institutional Repository, which might also be used for Dataset publication and discovery.
