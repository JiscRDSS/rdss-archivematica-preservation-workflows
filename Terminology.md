# Terminology

The following terminology is used in our preservation workflow descriptions.  

We use terminology from the Jisc RDSS [Canonical Data Model (CDM)](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model) and Jisc RDSS [Ubiquitous Language](https://jiscdev.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RDSSP/Ubiquitous+language) where possible.  We also try to be consistent with external RDM glossaries, in particular The International Research Data Management [(IRiDiuM)](https://review.casrai.org/iridium) glossary from [CASRAI](http://casrai.org/) including [proposed additions](https://review.casrai.org/iridium/) plus other well known sources of terminology such as [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org/).

In the context of digital preservation workflows, we are concerned with three main areas: the people and systems that produce data that needs to be preserved, the people and systems that are involved in [digital preservation](https://review.casrai.org/iridium/data_preservation) and long-term [data archiving](https://review.casrai.org/iridium/data_archiving), and the people and systems that need to access and consume data that has been preserved.  In the terminology of the Open Archival Information System [(OAIS)](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/650x0m2.pdf), these areas cover Producers, Management and Consumers.  

The Jisc CDM doesn't make a distinction between the production and consumption of research data and currently uses the DataCite [contributorType](https://schema.datacite.org/) as a placeholder for the CDM [Person Roles](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/blob/master/properties/Agent/Person/Person%20role.md) that people can take.  This is being reviewed by Jisc and the definitions will be updated at some point.  In the meantime, we have used the terms 'Data Producer' and 'Data Consumer' from IRiDiuM to distinguish between the sources of research data and the subsequent users of this research data.  This terminology matches OAIS.  Jisc have developed a set of [Personas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ig4r44U5k_RCkz0qRnBPhH8gpUDMcY7xs-AqCluo9lk/edit#gid=1444815476) which include Researcher, Research Manager and Data User which map quite well to IRiDiuM's Data Producer, Data Manager and Data Consumer respectively.

### Person Roles

* **Data Producer**.  [(IRiDiuM)](https://review.casrai.org/iridium/data_producer) "Individual or agent involved in planning, collecting, processing, or maintaining data in the original research project."  In our case, someone who creates/uploads/deposits [Research Data](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Research_data) into the Jisc RDSS, for example a Researcher or a PI.  Deposit could be directly to the RDSS or it could be via an Institutional Repository or CRIS.  Matching Jisc RDSS Personas include [Researchers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ig4r44U5k_RCkz0qRnBPhH8gpUDMcY7xs-AqCluo9lk/edit#gid=1856412652).  Also see [DataCite Creator / Contributor](https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.0/doc/DataCite-MetadataKernel_v4.0.pdf)

* **Data Manager**.  [(IRiDiuM)](https://review.casrai.org/iridium/data_manager) "The person who controls/oversees/manages the process of research data management."   In our case, someone who is responsible at an Institution for the long-term management, quality, compliance, accessibility and usability of research data generated by Data Producers at their institution.  The Data Manager could be a member of a specific Faculty or Dept or they could be part of a centralised team, e.g. Library, Governance or Research Office.  Matching Jisc RDSS Personas include Research Managers ([Archivist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ig4r44U5k_RCkz0qRnBPhH8gpUDMcY7xs-AqCluo9lk/edit#gid=1856412652), [RDM Librarian](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ig4r44U5k_RCkz0qRnBPhH8gpUDMcY7xs-AqCluo9lk/edit#gid=2101465877) and [Repository Manager](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ig4r44U5k_RCkz0qRnBPhH8gpUDMcY7xs-AqCluo9lk/edit#gid=1308797523)). Also see [IRiDiuM Data Steward](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Data_steward), [IRiDiuM Data Custodian](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Data_custodian), [IRiDiuM Research Data Librarian](https://review.casrai.org/iridium/research_data_librarian), [DataCite DataManager](https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.0/doc/DataCite-MetadataKernel_v4.0.pdf) and [IRiDiuM Research Data Management](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Research_data_management)

* **Data Consumer**.  [(IRiDiuM)](https://review.casrai.org/iridium/data_consumer) "The role played by those persons, or their software systems, that are interested in preserved data and can access it in detail."  In our case, someone who wants to use research data that is preserved and held by the RDSS.  For example, someone who might want to reuse data to do further research of their own, to validate the original research as done by the Data Producer, or to access data part of peer review of a publication describing some research based on the data.  Matching Jisc RDSS Personas include [Data Users](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ig4r44U5k_RCkz0qRnBPhH8gpUDMcY7xs-AqCluo9lk/edit#gid=601070932)

### Entities

* **Dataset**.  [(IRiDiuM)](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Dataset) "Any organized collection of data in a computational format, defined by a theme or category that reflects what is being measured/observed/monitored. The presentation of the data in the application is enabled through metadata.".  Also see [Jisc CDM Dataset](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/properties/Dataset) and [IRiDiuM Research Dataset](https://review.casrai.org/iridium/research_dataset).  A Dataset includes Files and [Metadata](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Metadata) (descriptive, technical, rights, preservation) that describes the dataset.  The existence and availability of a dataset may be recorded in a Catalog Record, Repository or CRIS but this isn't a pre-requisite for the dataset to exist, e.g. a dataset can exist in a researcher's own environment before being uploaded to the RDSS or registered in a Repository.  A dataset is an Object in the [Portand Common Data Model (PCDM)](http://pcdm.org/2016/04/18/models), e.g. see the [graphical representation of the Jisc CDM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/master/Data-Model/Diagrams/alpha-model/logical-model.png).  In the Jisc CDM, a dataset has a [ResourceType](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/blob/master/properties/Dataset/datasetResourceType.md) that describes the type of dataset in more detail.  In our case, we are agnostic to the resource type.  Provided a dataset contains Files and optional core metadata (e.g. DataCite) then it can go through the preservation process.


* **File**.  [(PCDM)](http://pcdm.org/models#File) "A File is a sequence of binary data and is described by some accompanying metadata.  The metadata typically includes at least basic technical metadata (size, content type, modification date, etc.), but can also include properties related to preservation, digitization process, provenance, etc.".  Also see [Jisc CDM File](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/properties/File).  A File's bitstream (binary data) is in a [Data file-format](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Data_file_format) (zip, pdf, csv, jpeg etc.). A File may have a [media type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml), also known as a mime type, which provides more information on the type of the content (image, video, document, table, geospatial etc.).  This is related to the File's [research data type](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Research_data_format).  In our case, a File has a wide range of properties that need to be captured, extracted and preserved including the File's name, size, format, type, origin and checksums.  A File belongs to a Dataset.

* **Repository**.  [(IRiDiuM)](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Repository) "Repositories preserve, manage, and provide access to many types of digital materials in a variety of formats. Materials in online repositories are curated to enable search, discovery, and reuse."  In our case, we use Repository as a catch-all term to refer to a system where some form of record is made of a Dataset so it can be discovered and accessed.  This includes Repositories hosted by the Jisc RDSS, local [Institutional Repositories](https://review.casrai.org/oa/institutional_repository), [CRIS](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/manage-your-research-information) or similar systems.

* **Jisc RDSS Messaging System**.  In the Jisc RDSS architecture, the components of the RDSS (Repository, Preservation System, Dashboard etc.) do not interact directly but are instead mediated by a messaging system.  For example, in our preservation workflows if we say that the Preservation System notifies the Repository then we actually mean that the Preservation System sends a message to the RDSS Messaging System which then passes this on to the Repository.

* **Preservation System**.  The open-source preservation platform in Lot 5 that allows the ongoing preservation of Datasets and their constituent Files.  The Preservation System is where Datasets can be processed to so that they will continue to be understandable and usable over time by Data Consumers.  This includes processing to (a) help understand the technical aspects of the dataset, e.g. the file formats being used, (b) conversion of files into more open or longer lived formats, e.g. normalisation, and (c) packaging of files and metadata in the dataset into containers that can be used to ensure the long-term authenticity and integrity of the dataset, e.g. Archive Information Packages.
