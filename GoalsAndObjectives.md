# Goals

* Describe the workflows that will be supported in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) preservation platform in a form that can be shared with the HEI pilots.
    
* Show the Higher Eductation Institution (HEI) pilots and Expert Advisopry Group (EAG) some of the ways in which digital preservation can fit into the wider research data management lifecycle of data upload, description, publication, access and re-use.

# Objectives

* Describe two example research data digital preservation workflows that will be supported by the RDSS preservation platform MVP (Alpha stage of the project).

* Provide visibility and transparency to the HEI pilots of what Arkivum/Artefactual/Jisc are aiming for in Lot 5 (digital preservation platform)

* Describe the workflows in a form that is easy to understand by non-technical people involved in the HEI pilots.
    
* Provide workflows that will enable HEIs to explore the range of functionality provided by the Archivematica tool so they will then better understand what is possible and what further features need to be added in the beta.

* Provide a concrete foundation for Arkivum/Artefactual/Jisc to explore and agree the specific integration needed between the preservation platform and the rest of the RDSS, e.g. events, data model, data transfers etc.

* Identify alternative or enhanced research data preservation workflows that could be supported in the beta phase of the project.
